   <h2> Monster Hunter
   </h2>
     <ul>
	    <li> Kill Bigfoots
	    </li>
	    <li> Kill Yetis
	    </li>
	    <li> Feed Nessi 
	    </li>
	 </ul>
	 <h2> Chemistry Teacher
   </h2>
     <ul>
	    <li> Provide safe and positive learning environment for learning Chemistry
	    </li>
	    <li> Challenge the students of Albuquerque with engaging lessons
	    </li>
	    <li> Be the biggest wholesale retailer of blue rocky candy in entire mid-west (Breaking Bad Reference)
	    </li>
	 </ul>
	 <h2> Elder God  
     </h2>
     <ul>
	    <li> Sleep for Eons
	    </li>
	    <li> Drive mortals insane
	    </li>
	    <li> Degrade my legacy by doing things like showing up in South Park
	    </li>
	 </ul>
	 <p> I studied at Eldrich unitersity where I learned to be omnipotent, and omnipresent. It's not easy being an elder God
	     but someone has to do it. Anyone can nowadays because H.P. Lovecraft's work is public domain. Being omnipotent made 
		 learning to be a chemist and a monster hunter much easier though. It's not wasy but in the end it is worth it. Blah,
		 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
		 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah,
		 blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
